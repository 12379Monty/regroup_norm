## Response  {-}

* Literature Review: Inferring Age from Omic Profiles

### Introduction

The association between omic profiles and subject age has become a crucial area of research in aging biology. Omic-based models leverage molecular features such as DNA methylation, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to infer chronological and biological age. This review synthesizes recent findings on the predictive capability of omic profiles for age inference, highlighting the number of features used, model architectures, and the gain in predictive accuracy due to omic feature inclusion.

### Omic-Based Age Prediction Models

#### 1. Multi-Omics Age Prediction Approaches

Chen et al. (2023) developed OMICmAge, an integrative multi-omics approach that predicts biological age by combining DNA methylation (DNAm) with proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data [(Chen et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-chen-dwaraka/3281ad73801b5cb3bfdf3c6b190dd010/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their elastic-net regression model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting mortality risk compared to existing biomarkers.

Dwaraka et al. (2024) further refined OMICmAge, reporting an average ROC of 0.88 for predicting 5- and 10-year mortality [(Dwaraka et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-dwaraka-chen/4b2a974fdb4a57d09c85a121b156317d/?utm_source=chatgpt).

#### 2. Metabolomic Clocks

Hwangbo et al. (2021) developed a metabolomic aging clock using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolite and lipid data [(Hwangbo et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-metabolomic-aging-clock-using-human-csf-hwangbo-zhang/1431a6651f09501fbf5a2a986a81ca91/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their predictive models estimated chronological age within 10 years. Key metabolites associated with aging included the carnitine shuttle, sucrose, biopterin, and vitamin E metabolism.

Robinson et al. (2018) integrated metabolomics and DNA methylation data to assess metabolic age acceleration in a UK cohort [(Robinson et al., 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/metabolomic-aging-and-its-association-with-depression-in-a-robinson-hyam/38b2b6b774fb53c384e568ecdc35b41b/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their elastic-net model used 472 features and achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.85 with chronological age.

#### 3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Van Hilten et al. (2023) implemented biologically interpretable neural networks for multi-omics age prediction using RNA expression and CpG methylation data [(Van Hilten et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/phenotype-prediction-using-biologically-interpretable-hilten-rooij/752664ee876f5317a1be6aec64e9ce66/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their model inferred age with a mean error of 5.16 years and identified consistently predictive genes such as COL11A2, AFAP1, and CD34.

#### 4. Machine Learning for Omic Feature Selection

Uche et al. (2021) investigated the role of omics in improving machine learning interpretability [(Uche et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/can-omics-help-in-prognostic-machine-learning-uche-caruana/5b496ae621ca5fdeba66c5cfafff7c1c/?utm_source=chatgpt). Their Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) demonstrated that incorporating omic features enhanced the model’s predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Zenbout et al. (2023) proposed an optimized bioinspired feature selection approach for omic data analysis, which significantly improved predictive performance in clinical endpoint predictions [(Zenbout et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/efficient-bioinspired-feature-selection-and-machine-zenbout-bouramoul/98159e634b9958aea029c8a8f7699ef4/?utm_source=chatgpt).

### Gain in Predictive Accuracy Due to Omic Features

- **OMICmAge**: Outperformed traditional biomarkers with an ROC of 0.88 [(Dwaraka et al., 2024)](https://consensus.app/papers/omicmage-an-integrative-multiomics-approach-to-quantify-dwaraka-chen/4b2a974fdb4a57d09c85a121b156317d/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Metabolomic Aging Clocks**: Achieved age predictions within a 10-year margin [(Hwangbo et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/a-metabolomic-aging-clock-using-human-csf-hwangbo-zhang/1431a6651f09501fb5a2a986a81ca91/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Deep Learning Models**: Reduced mean absolute error to 5.16 years [(Van Hilten et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/phenotype-prediction-using-biologically-interpretable-hilten-rooij/752664ee876f5317a1be6aec64e9ce66/?utm_source=chatgpt).
- **Machine Learning Interpretability**: Increased model accuracy by incorporating omic features [(Uche et al., 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/can-omics-help-in-prognostic-machine-learning-uche-caruana/5b496ae621ca5fdeba66c5cfafff7c1c/?utm_source=chatgpt).

### Conclusion

Recent advancements in age prediction using omic profiles demonstrate the potential of multi-omics integration and machine learning models in improving chronological and biological age inference. The use of deep learning and optimized feature selection methods has significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights into aging biology and age-related diseases.

## **Response**  {-}

Here's a statistical review of the paper by Sood et al. (2015), focusing exclusively on statistical methodologies and considerations as outlined in your request:

---

* Statistical Review of "A novel multi-tissue RNA diagnostic of healthy ageing relates to cognitive health status" by Sood et al. (2015)

This review critically assesses the statistical aspects of the analysis and data handling described by Sood et al. (2015) with special attention to sampling strategies, dataset pooling, normalization procedures, and classifier validation strategies.

### 1. Training Data and Target Population Representation

Sood et al. initiated their classifier development using a **training dataset** comprising RNA samples from skeletal muscle of 15 healthy younger individuals (aged 19–28) and 15 healthy older individuals (aged 59–77). The older group was explicitly described as sedentary but in otherwise good health, with no diabetes and good aerobic capacity. The younger group appears similarly healthy and sedentary, providing a reasonable initial basis for constructing a classifier differentiating healthy ageing from youth.

- **Representativeness and Random Sampling**:  
  The authors described their cohorts as healthy and explicitly sedentary, implying homogeneity, which supports the concept of an appropriate representative subset for their target population. However, the limited sample size (30 total individuals) and narrow geographic/ethnic sampling (not fully specified) raise questions about generalizability. A more rigorous randomization or stratification process in initial sample selection would further strengthen claims about representativeness.

- **Adequacy of Sample Size**:  
The sample size (n = 30) for initial training is minimal, particularly given the high dimensionality (~54,000 probe-sets). Although machine learning methods (k-nearest neighbor, kNN) employed here are robust against some overfitting, the small training size could limit the stability and generalizability of selected RNA markers.

The researchers pooled data across multiple external validation studies to test the generalizability of their RNA signature. They used four independent muscle datasets (Trappe, Hoffman, Derby, Kraus datasets) to externally validate the classifier and additional data sets from human brain and skin.

- **Number of Runs Aggregated**:
  - Original training dataset: n=30
  - Independent muscle validation: n = 129 total (across four studies)
  - Brain tissue dataset: 120 samples
  - Skin dataset: 279 samples (up to 3 technical replicates/sample)

This extensive external validation across diverse datasets, including various laboratories, technologies, and tissues, is a commendable statistical practice enhancing reliability.

### Tissue Type Distribution Across Runs
Multiple tissue types (muscle, brain, skin) were independently tested. However, the explicit distribution across individual data generation runs is not detailed clearly, especially how balanced the tissue sampling was within each laboratory batch or platform. Potential batch effects could affect classifier robustness and are not clearly addressed analytically.

### Association of Run with Age
The authors did not explicitly discuss any statistical analysis regarding whether age was confounded by the data generation run. Given their broad range of validation samples, systematic bias is possible, yet their external validation results strongly imply robustness against run-specific biases.

### Normalization Across Different Runs and Platforms

Normalization approaches were appropriate and clearly reported:

- **Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA)** for initial normalization (single-laboratory data).
- **Frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis (fRMA)** for multi-center Affymetrix arrays, accommodating inter-laboratory variability.
- **Quantile normalization** for Illumina platforms.

Such normalization steps are crucial to mitigating batch effects and make cross-platform validation statistically valid. The authors appropriately reported these normalization methods.

### Statistical Robustness and Validation of Classifier Performance

Classifier development relied on:

- **k-nearest neighbor (kNN)** methods, known for capturing non-linear interactions and robust classification.
- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**: Employed rigorously for internal validation.
- **External Validation**: Four independent muscle studies, and datasets from brain and skin, using fully independent datasets for both training and evaluation (true external validation).

#### Evidence of Classifier Generalizability:

- Independent classification across muscle datasets yielded ~93% accuracy (range: 70–100%).
- Cross-tissue validation results were impressive, with high accuracy: brain (AUC ~0.91) and skin (AUC ~0.85).
- Application to two independent blood datasets demonstrated robust performance in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from control (AUC 0.66–0.73 independently, up to 0.86 combined with an AD-specific signature).

This consistent success across diverse datasets and independent validations is strong statistical evidence of robustness. However, the performance of the classifier on future, yet-to-be-seen data remains theoretical without prospective validation.

---

### Predictive Utility and Independence from Lifestyle Factors

- The authors statistically evaluated the classifier's independence from known lifestyle factors (e.g., blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, physical activity) using the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) cohort. They explicitly demonstrated no significant correlation between the healthy ageing gene score and these common confounders, providing strong statistical evidence of biological specificity.
- The ULSAM cohort results also showed significant association between the gene score at ~70 years and renal function at 82 years (p=0.009), and 20-year survival (p=0.0295). This suggests statistical robustness in prognostic utility.

---

### Predictive Validity for Future Data

The authors have explicitly discussed the classifier's prospective validity in predicting age-related health outcomes, particularly cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, based on the application of their signature in independent blood samples. Statistical evidence (AUC values ranging from 0.66 to 0.86) supports the model's future predictive capacity, although explicitly prospective validation data (follow-up beyond the ULSAM cohort) were not presented.

### Conclusion (Statistical Perspective)

From a statistical perspective, the methods employed by Sood et al. (2015) demonstrate careful consideration of critical principles, including rigorous external validation, appropriate normalization, and verification of classifier independence from potential confounding factors. However, minor methodological limitations remain concerning sample representativeness and potential platform-specific biases despite their robust cross-validation strategy.

**In conclusion**, from a statistical viewpoint, the manuscript by Sood et al. (2015) demonstrates robust statistical methodologies, especially in the context of external validation and normalization across platforms, although it could be improved by more explicit statistical tests addressing representativeness and platform-run age associations.

## chatGPT RE:Prompt {-}

Note that what the authors  call external validation  entails fitting a new model with each dataset.  There is no validation of a model; only validation that the subset of 150 probe sets are sufficient to enable KNN + LOOCV to give rise to a fitted model that still discriminates.  This is not validation in the usual sense.  There is no attempt to compare the fitted models from the different data sets.  Jacob and Speed (attached) show that repeating the fit and eval procedures with a random selection of 150 probe sets achieves similar discrimination on some datasets.
Please include these facts in the conclusions to be drawn form these data.

*  Statistical Conclusions from Review of Sood et al. (2015)

The analysis by Sood et al. (2015) introduces a 150-gene RNA classifier derived from muscle tissue to discriminate "healthy ageing" across multiple tissues. The statistical methodology used included k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification coupled with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The authors reported successful classification across various tissues (muscle, brain, and skin) and argued for robust multi-tissue applicability.

However, a critical examination reveals important methodological caveats:

- **Representativeness and Sampling**: The initial training dataset comprised only 30 individuals (15 younger and 15 older), raising concerns about the statistical generalizability of this subset to broader populations. While the authors explicitly considered health status, factors such as ethnicity, geography, or more subtle genetic backgrounds were not addressed in detail, limiting the claim of representativeness.

- **Aggregation and Normalization**: Although multiple datasets were used for external validation, what the authors termed "external validation" actually involved re-fitting classifiers to each dataset independently, rather than true independent validation of a single pre-specified model.

- **Normalization Across Platforms**: The normalization procedures (RMA, fRMA) were statistically appropriate and strengthened their cross-platform analysis. However, each dataset had its own normalization procedure, which could have introduced additional variability or biases not fully quantified.

- **Classifier Performance and Validity**: The k-nearest neighbor approach is methodologically sound and robust, but the authors' repeated fitting of new models to each validation dataset limits the interpretability of their claim of generalizability.

- **Evidence for Predictive Robustness**: Jacob and Speed (2018) showed that selecting random subsets of 150 probe sets can yield similar discrimination results on independent datasets, questioning the uniqueness or biological significance of the specific 150-gene set selected by Sood et al.

- **Lack of Unique Diagnostic Power**: The random selection analysis performed by Jacob and Speed underscores that the observed classification performance could largely be attributed to chance or general differences in gene expression between groups (age groups or AD status), rather than the specific biological validity of the selected markers.

In summary, while Sood et al. demonstrated some capability for their RNA signatures to distinguish biological groups (young vs. old, AD vs. control), the absence of genuine external validation, coupled with evidence from random selection analyses, indicates that their particular gene set may not offer specific or biologically insightful diagnostic capabilities beyond what can be randomly achieved with similar-sized gene subsets. These findings emphasize the importance of robust external validation and careful consideration of the randomness in gene signature selection when developing and validating genomic diagnostics.

* Abstract
   -  Diagnostics of the human ageing process may help predict
later healthcare needs or guide preventative measures for tackling
diseases of older age. 
   - We take a transcriptomics approach to build
the first reproducible multi-tissue RNA expression signature by
gene-chip profiling tissue from sedentary normal subjects who
reached 65 years of age in good health.
   - In the present study we developed a RNA classifier of ‘healthy’ 
ageing starting with human muscle, with the hypothesis that this 
gene expression pattern may provide reliable genomic predictors for 
risk of age-related disease. 
   - We built the RNA classifier using human <i>muscle</i> global 
gene expression profiles because it has proven a useful tissue for
predicting systemic physiological traits in humans [@Timmons:2010aa]
and because we can define healthy physiological status with ease [@Keller:2010aa].
   - When the RNA classifier was related to cognitive health, this
‘healthy ageing gene score’ had the advantage of being hypothesis driven (**???**),
and built using a paradigm and samples entirely distinct from clinical
case–control samples. 
   - When applied to blood RNA, we established good validation for
AD diagnosis and selectivity over common age-related pathologies.
   - The results of the present study further support the idea that analysis
of peripheral blood RNA would be a fruitful strategy for developing biomarkers
of cognitive health and prove that **a common healthy ageing gene-expression
program is detectable across multiple tissues**.

#### Comment {-}

* From the abstract this appears to be an unconventional method which defies
the most rudimentary guidelines of good statistical practice: PQRS 

* Expand on PQRS

* When investigators believe that they have discovered something useful -
in this case some classifier with some accuracy - it may be hard to cast doubt 
on the results because of flaws in the method used to derive the results.  

* An alternative is to show that an equivalent result can be obtained
from a sham procedure.

* **Question - can any AI analysis tell us that the procedure in 
Sood  et al. (2014) is wacky?

* Abstract
   - In a recent publication, Sood et al. (Genome Biol 16:185, 2015)
presented a set of 150 probe sets that could be used in the diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on gene expression. We reproduce some of
their experiments and show that their signature is indeed able to discriminate
between AD and control patients using blood gene expression in two cohorts.
We also show that its performance does not stand out compared to randomly
sampled sets of 150 probe sets from the same array.
