Figure 1. Genomic assays are often highly reproducible, but have significant efficiency variation across the genome.\n  (A) Two genomic hybridization signals (biological replicates) from (Lee et al., 2007) shown along a portion of Car III are highly reproducible, but deviate significantly from the expected constant signal.\n (B) Across the whole genome, these variations are highly reproducible. Two genomic hybridizations for the entire yeast genome are highly correlated (Pearson C = 0.966).
