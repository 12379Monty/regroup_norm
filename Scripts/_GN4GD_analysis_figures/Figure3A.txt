Figure 3 Overview of Group Normalization.\n Probes are shown sorted by on their values in a genomic hybridization (reference condition, black). For each probe, N = 1000 probes with closest signal in the genomic hybridization are assigned as reference set (dashed boxes) for each probe. Then high (red) and low (green) signal levels in the experimental condition (grey) are estimated from high and low probe signal ranges for each set of reference probes.
