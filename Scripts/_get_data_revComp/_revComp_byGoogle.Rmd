Based on the user's query, "wrapper around Biostrings::reverse Complement to handle erections," it is clear there is a typo and the user most likely meant to type "errors" instead of "erections". The following wrapper function for  handles potential input errors by using the  function in R. This allows the code to continue execution even if a specific sequence causes the  function to fail, instead of crashing the entire script. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Wrapper function using  This function attempts the reverse complement operation and returns a specified value (e.g.,  or ) if an error occurs. This is useful when processing a  where some sequences might be malformed or invalid. [6]  
How to use the wrapper With a single  objectThis example shows how the  function works with both valid and invalid  inputs. 
With a  objectThis example demonstrates how to apply the wrapper to a set of sequences using  or , which is safer than a direct loop for  objects. [4]  
How it works • : The core of the error handling is the  function. It evaluates an expression, and if an error is thrown, it executes a specified error-handling function instead of stopping the program. 
• : This argument defines the function to be called if an error occurs. The error message is passed to this function as the argument . 
• : Inside the error handler, a  is issued to notify the user of the problem, including the specific sequence that caused the error. 
• : Instead of crashing, the function returns , allowing the processing of the other sequences in the set to continue uninterrupted. 
• : Applying the wrapper with  is a straightforward way to process each sequence individually and collect the results. The  check is then used to remove any sequences that failed the operation. [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
