The query "Affy titling aerrayyapproximately 2% of total probes were truncated to economize on the required number of oligonucleotide synthesis steps. this is not reflected i" appears to contain typographical errors. The most likely interpretation is a question about Affymetrix microarrays, specifically the truncation of probes for cost-saving measures and how this is (or is not) reflected in probe annotation files. There is no public documentation from Affymetrix to confirm such a systematic 2% truncation. The issue is likely a misunderstanding of a different quality control measure. [1, 2]  
Probable source of the misunderstanding 
The reference to "2% of total probes were truncated" and the need to "economize on the required number of oligonucleotide synthesis steps" is likely a misinterpretation of one or more of the following: 

• Background correction: The Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS 5.0) software defined a background level based on the average intensity of the dimmest 2% of features within specific regions of the array. This is a data normalization step and is not a reference to truncated probes. 
• Probe re-annotation: Later analyses by independent researchers showed that when using updated genomic information (custom CDFs), many Affymetrix probes were found to be inaccurate or mistargeted and were effectively "lost" in the re-annotation process. This could affect between 44% and 71% of probes, depending on the array type, which is a much larger percentage than 2%. 
• Probe synthesis efficiency: Oligonucleotide synthesis is not 100% efficient. With each cycle, a small percentage of chains fail to extend. The efficiency drops with each added base, resulting in a population of truncated probes on the array. However, this is an unavoidable technical limitation, not a deliberate design decision to "economize." [2, 3, 4, 5]  

How probe truncation and quality issues are reflected 
Probe issues, including synthesis failure and poor performance, are accounted for during data analysis. 

• 3'/5' ratio: Older Affymetrix arrays used control probe sets located at the 3', middle, and 5' ends of housekeeping genes like GAPDH and -actin. A high 3'/5' ratio indicated poor RNA quality, suggesting the target RNA molecules themselves were truncated and preferentially detected at their 3' end. 
• Probe-level analysis: Modern microarray data analysis pipelines, such as those within the Bioconductor software project, use statistical models that evaluate the performance of individual probes. The models account for variations in probe signal intensity, some of which are caused by sequence-specific binding affinities and poor-quality probes. 
• Custom CDFs: The use of custom Chip Description Files (CDFs), such as those from the Brainarray project, effectively bypasses Affymetrix's original probe groupings. This process re-annotates probes based on modern genome sequences, filtering out probes that are non-specific or map to the wrong genes. This results in more accurate expression measurements but also discards poorly performing probes. 
• The 'maskBAD' package: Tools exist to identify and remove problematic probes directly. For example, the  R package was developed to detect and filter Affymetrix probes with hybridization differences that could lead to false positives and confound analysis. [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
