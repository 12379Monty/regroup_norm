  - From Chat Reproducing Lee 2007 Genomic Probe Intensity Plots 
  - In Project Group Normalization for Genomic Data

Went back to getting Base R code using package::function() invocation style.
This supersedes the code from the previous chats, but the latter provides an alternative.

2 R codes 1 py and 1 plot artifact

* group_normalization_r.r

* group_normalization_base_r.r

* nucleosome_plot.py


  - From Chat Normalization Validation in Genomic Studies
  - In Project Group Normalization for Genomic Data

*  nucleosome_normalization.r - Nucleosome Positioning Group Noemalization
   - R script for reproducing figures from "Group Normalization for Genomic Data" (Ghandi & Beer, 2012)
      -  This script provides functions to download data, process it, and visualize nucleosome positioning data


* **article_summary.md** 

* **GN4GD_implementationGuide.md**
   - explains nucleosome_normalization.r and provides talk outline

* R code: Analysis of Lee 2007 Nucleosome Occupancy Data Using Group

```
I'll create code to download and analyze the actual data from the Lee 2007 paper using the ArrayExpress accession code E-MEXP-1172. This will allow us to reproduce the paper's analyses with the original data instead of simulated data.

Let me check the current location of the dataset in BioStudies since ArrayExpress has been migrated:

Let me try another approach to find information about downloading this dataset:

Let me try to find a direct download link for the dataset:

Based on my search, I can see that the data from E-MEXP-1172 should be available on the EBI FTP site. Let me check if we can directly access the FTP path:

Let me try to find a direct path to the FTP site:

Based on my research, it appears that the E-MEXP-1172 dataset should be available at the following FTP path:
```
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/arrayexpress/data/experiment/MEXP/E-MEXP-1172/
```

However, direct FTP access might be restricted now as the ArrayExpress has been migrated to BioStudies. 

Let me try a different approach by using the Bioconductor package to download the data. I'll create R code to download and analyze the Lee 2007 nucleosome occupancy data.

I've created an R code artifact that attempts to analyze the Lee 2007 nucleosome occupancy data (E-MEXP-1172) using the Group Normalization method from the Ghandi & Beer paper. Here's what the code does:

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Attempts to download the E-MEXP-1172 dataset from ArrayExpress using multiple methods
   - Includes a fallback to use simulated nucleosome occupancy data if the download fails

2. **Simulated Data Generation**:
   - Creates realistic simulated nucleosome positioning data based on the paper's description
   - Models probe effects, nucleosome positions (~147bp), and promoter regions with depleted nucleosomes
   - Generates data for all 16 yeast chromosomes

3. **Group Normalization Implementation**:
   - Implements the Binary Group Normalization algorithm as described in the paper
   - Includes chromosome-by-chromosome processing for better performance
   - Implements the Cross Normalization variant for comparing two conditions

4. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Provides functions to plot normalized nucleosome occupancy at specific genomic regions
   - Analyzes nucleosome occupancy around promoters
   - Creates average nucleosome occupancy profiles around transcription start sites

5. **Output**:
   - Saves the normalized data and visualization plots

The code is designed to be robust against potential download issues with the original data, providing a simulated dataset that captures the key characteristics of nucleosome positioning data. This allows you to see how the Group Normalization method works on realistic data, even if the original dataset cannot be accessed.

If you want to use this with other datasets or adapt it for different experiments, you would primarily need to modify the data loading section while keeping the normalization and analysis functions the same.
