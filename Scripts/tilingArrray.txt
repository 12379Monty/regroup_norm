The "tilingArray" R package, available on Bioconductor.org (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/tilingArray.html), is designed for analyzing high-density oligonucleotide tiling microarray data, which are used for transcript mapping to identify the architecture and abundance of RNA transcripts across the genome. The package provides functions for segmentation of linear data, fitting piecewise constant models, calculating confidence intervals, generating plots, and normalizing data to adjust for probe-sequence-dependent responses, aiding in the discovery of novel RNA elements. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
What are Tiling Arrays? 

• Tiling arrays are a type of microarray that uses a dense set of probes to cover a significant portion of a genome, rather than focusing on specific known genes like traditional arrays. 
• They provide a comprehensive, unbiased view of genomic expression, enabling the identification of previously unknown transcriptional regions, such as non-coding RNAs and antisense RNAs. [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]  

Key Functionality of the "tilingArray" PackageThe "tilingArray" package offers several tools for processing and interpreting this data: 

1. Segmentation: It includes classes and functions for segmenting linear data, which is crucial for identifying distinct regions of high or low transcript abundance along the genome. 
2. Dynamic Programming: A function called  fits piecewise constant models using a fast and exact dynamic programming algorithm to find these constant regions. 
3. Confidence Intervals: The  function allows for the calculation of confidence intervals using the strucchange package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/tilingArray.html), providing a measure of uncertainty in the identified regions. 
4. Data Visualization: A  function facilitates the creation of detailed plots for visualizing the data along the chromosome. 
5. Data Normalization: The  function helps to adjust the data by accounting for variations in probe-sequence-dependent hybridization, improving the accuracy of transcript abundance measurements. [3]  

Applications 
Transcript Mapping: The primary use is to map transcripts and understand their abundance and architecture across the genome.Discovery of Novel RNAs: By providing a complete genomic view, tiling arrays, and thus the "tilingArray" package, are powerful tools for discovering new types of RNA molecules.ChIP-chip Data Analysis: Although not the main focus, the package's segmentation capabilities can also be applied to analyze ChIP-chip data, which uses tiling arrays to map DNA-protein interactions genome-wide.
